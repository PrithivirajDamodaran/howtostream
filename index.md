## Welcome to howtostream.org 

This is a collaborative forum primarily for sharing use cases,code and benchmarks on stream processing technologies for big data platforms. So effectively the aim is to educate the developer community and organisations to make informed decisions for picking up the right tools/frameworks for the right usecases. Today, the choice architecture  is very confusing inspite of few good initiatives like [this](https://www.slideshare.net/ConfluentInc/a-practical-guide-to-selecting-a-stream-processing-technology) and [this](https://www.confluent.io/blog/making-sense-of-stream-processing/). Because there are many overlapping/confusing use cases, new frameworks, terminologies and most of all claims w/o unbiased performance benchmarks which makes it a overwhelming decision to make. 

This is still in a very nascent stage, feel free to chip and share your thoughts.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/howtostream/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

As of today this is initiated and maitained by [Prithiviraj Damodaran](https://twitter.com/prithivida). So feel free to reach out to him should you have any questions.

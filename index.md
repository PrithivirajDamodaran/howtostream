## Welcome to howtostream.org 

This is a collaborative forum on information like new features, updates, and mainly use cases/code/benchmarks on stream processing technology for data platforms. Hence this aims at educating the developer community and organisations to make informed decisions for picking up the right tools/frameworks for the right usecases. Today, the choice architecture  is very confusing inspite of good initiatives like [this](https://www.slideshare.net/ConfluentInc/a-practical-guide-to-selecting-a-stream-processing-technology) and [this](https://www.confluent.io/blog/making-sense-of-stream-processing/). Because there are many overlapping/confusing use cases, business requirements, jargons and most of all claims w/o unbiased performance benchmarks which makes it a overwhelming decision to make. 

This is still in a very nascent stage, feel free to chip and share your thoughts.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/howtostream/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
